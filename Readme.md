#📊 Top Programming Languages Dashboard (Power BI)


##📌 Project Overview

This Power BI dashboard presents a historical analysis of top programming languages based on their year of creation and founders/creators.
The objective of this project is to understand how programming languages evolved over time and identify periods of high innovation and key contributors.

The analysis is purely informational and historical, based only on the available dataset.

##🗂 Dataset Description

The dataset contains information about 100 programming languages with the following columns:

Language – Name of the programming language

Founder/Creator – Individual or organization that created the language

Year – Year in which the language was created

Time Range: 1949 – 2023

##❓ Key Questions Answered

The dashboard is designed to answer these questions:

How many programming languages are included in the dataset?

What is the earliest and latest year of programming language creation?

How many programming languages were created per decade?

Which founders or creators contributed the most programming languages?

How are programming languages distributed across different decades?

What languages correspond to specific founders and creation years?

##🛠 Data Preparation

A Decade column was derived from the Year column to enable decade-wise analysis.

Data types were validated to ensure correct aggregation and visualization.

##🎯 Key Insights

Programming language creation increased significantly during the late 20th century.

Certain decades show higher innovation activity than others.

Some founders and organizations have contributed multiple programming languages.

The dataset reflects the historical evolution of programming languages rather than popularity or usage.

##⚠️ Limitations

The dataset does not include popularity, usage statistics, demand, or salary data.

The analysis is limited to creation year and founders only.

Insights are historical, not predictive.

##🧰 Tools Used

- Power BI Desktop

- CSV Dataset

- Power Query for data transformation

##📌 Conclusion

This dashboard provides a clear and structured view of the evolution of programming languages over time, helping users understand innovation trends and contributor impact using historical data.
