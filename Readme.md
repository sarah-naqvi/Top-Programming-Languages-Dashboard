📊 Top Programming Languages Dashboard (Power BI)
📌 Project Overview

This Power BI dashboard provides a historical analysis of programming languages based on their year of creation and founders/creators.
The goal of this project is to understand how programming languages have evolved over time, identify periods of high innovation, and highlight key contributors.

The analysis is purely historical and informational, derived strictly from the available dataset.

🗂 Dataset Description

The dataset contains information on 100 programming languages with the following attributes:

Language – Name of the programming language

Founder/Creator – Individual or organization that created the language

Year – Year the language was introduced

Time Range: 1949 – 2023

❓ Key Questions Answered

This dashboard answers the following questions:

How many programming languages are included in the dataset?

What are the earliest and most recent years of programming language creation?

How many programming languages were created in each decade?

Which founders or creators contributed the most programming languages?

How are programming languages distributed across different decades?

Which languages correspond to specific founders and creation years?

🎯 Key Insights

Programming language creation increased significantly during the late 20th century.

Certain decades experienced higher innovation compared to others.

Some individuals and organizations contributed multiple programming languages.

The dataset reflects the historical evolution of programming languages rather than their popularity or usage.

⚠️ Limitations

No data on popularity, usage, demand, or salary trends.

Analysis is limited to creation year and founder information.

Insights are descriptive and historical, not predictive.

🧰 Tools Used
